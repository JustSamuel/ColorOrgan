# ColorOrgan
> A [P3] script that turns sound into RGB values that you can connect to a LED strip!

## Features
- Uses FFT to turn sound into color
- Customizable

## Installation
As of now I have yet to make a good tutorial / instruction on how 
to install the script and run it.

As of know the only way is to download all the java classes and compile it yourself.

## TODO
- Save and load settings
- User friendly installation procedure.
